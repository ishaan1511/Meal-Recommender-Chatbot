# Meal-Recommender-Chatbot

## Introduction

This project explores the integration of large language models with structured nutritional datasets to enable interpretable, constraint-based food recommendation. Natural-language user inputs are parsed into a formal nutrient-constraint schema, which is subsequently used to optimize and rank food choices across both macronutrient and micronutrient dimensions. By combining rule-based heuristics with learned representations, the system demonstrates a practical hybrid approach to personalized nutrition modeling and decision support.
